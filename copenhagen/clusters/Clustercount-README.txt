Clustercount is a 692 x 692 matrix
each row and column corresponds to a different ID in the bt_symmetric.csv dataset.
This matrix is symmetric; both (a,b) and (b,a) represent the number of bins (samples every 5 minutes) that the pair a and b were in contact.
Unlike smallS, here the rows and columns are sorted by the clusters.
treeIDlist has the original IDs of these rows and columns (0 to 845).
